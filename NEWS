ipx-utils continues development of usersapce IPX utilities for Linux. Since
sunsite.unc.edu is not available anymore, latest version of the utilities can
be downloaded at https://github.com/pasis/ipx-utils. Also, IPX support was
removed in Linux 4.18 and for newer kernels you will need external ipx module
which can be downloaded at https://github.com/pasis/ipx.
